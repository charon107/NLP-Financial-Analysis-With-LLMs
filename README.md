# Project Introduction

Analyzing financial documents containing text, graphs, and charts is a rapidly growing area because it reduces the manual labor needed to analyze extensive documents. These analyses are particularly important for downstream applications such as stock market prediction and investment.

In this project, we aim to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze financial reports and documents containing text and images, serving various downstream applications such as classification or generation for different objectives.

## Project Goals

- **Automated Text Analysis**: Use LLMs to conduct in-depth analysis of financial documents to extract key information.
- **Image and Chart Understanding**: Interpret the charts and graphs in the documents through advanced image recognition technologies.
- **Downstream Applications**: Apply the analysis results to fields such as stock market prediction and investment decisions.
